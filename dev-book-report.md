**Why does this video/article interest you?**
  This video interests me because I think that what it teaches will be useful for future projects. The methods of ensuring the grid remains responsive will definitely be of use for website layouts. If I'm feeling ambitious, varying image sizes within the layout or even adding animations to a project would make it stand out a lot more, too.

**Given the date of publication, is it still relevant?**
  I believe that it's still relevant, seeing that it was published a bit over two years ago. CSS grid and responsive layouts are certainly still highly-relevant.

**How do you know the author is credible?**
  I know that the author is credible due to his popularity. Fireship seems to have a good reputation - online dev spaces tend to reference jokes from his videos and he doesn't seem to have any drama or controversies following him like some other popular tech youtubers.
